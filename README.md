# Daily Planner

## Description

This daily planner is designed for people who wants to plan their daily schedule. It will be able to update the planner according to the day and time with clear indications of which is current, past, or future time. Thus, this makes it easier for people to use and effective as it is very responsive.

This daily planner is only for between 9AM to 5PM because it is more for office usage rather than a full day planner.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions on how to use the planner:

1. Open the link https://levigun.github.io/daily-planner/ .

2. Once the page loads, it will show the daily planner with timeblocks from 9AM-5PM.

3. The top of the page will show the current date.

4. The color of the blocks will change according to time, for certain times the colors will be indicated below:
    Current: Red
    Past: Light Gray
    Future: Green

5. You can type in any event in each block and there will be a save button next to it. When you click the button, your event will be saved to the page.

6. When the page reloads, your events will be showcased and the colors of the timeblocks will change according to the time the page is opened.

7. When it is the next day, the daily planner will state the next day at the top of the page and automatically deletes all the events from the day before.
